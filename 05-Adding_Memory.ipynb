       "\n",
       "1. **Epidemic Prevention**: In the context of pandemic influenza, deep reinforcement learning can be used to automatically learn prevention strategies. By constructing epidemiological models and using reinforcement learning techniques, policies can be learned to control the spread of infectious diseases<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Sparse Reward Tasks**: Reinforcement learning can be challenging when dealing with tasks that have sparse rewards. One approach is self-imitation learning, where the agent imitates past good trajectories to encourage exploitation. Another approach is exploration bonuses, which enhance exploration by providing intrinsic rewards for visiting novel states. A novel framework called Explore-then-Exploit (EE) combines these two approaches to strengthen their effects and achieve better performance in episodic reward settings<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206262/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

       "Reinforcement learning has various use cases in different domains. Here are some examples:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Epidemic Prevention**: Reinforcement learning can be used to automatically learn prevention strategies for infectious diseases. For example, a study used deep reinforcement learning to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space<sup>[1]</sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Sparse Reward Tasks**: Reinforcement learning can be applied to tasks with sparse rewards. One approach is self-imitation learning, which encourages the agent to exploit past good trajectories. Another approach is exploration bonuses, which enhance exploration by providing intrinsic rewards for visiting novel states. A novel framework called Explore-then-Exploit (EE) interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to strengthen the effect of both algorithms<sup>[2]</sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Personalized Recommendation Systems**: Reinforcement learning can be used to improve personalized recommendation systems. For example, a personalized hybrid recommendation algorithm for music based on reinforcement learning was proposed. It recommends song sequences that match listeners' preferences better by simulating the interaction process and continuously updating the model based on preferences<sup>[3]</sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Feature Engineering**: Reinforcement learning can aid in automating feature engineering, which is a time-consuming task in machine learning projects. A framework called Cross-data Automatic Feature Engineering Machine (CAFEM) formalizes the feature engineering problem as an optimization problem over a Feature Transformation Graph (FTG). CAFEM consists of a FE learner (FeL) and a Cross-data Component (CdC) to speed up feature engineering learning on unseen datasets<sup>[4]</sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Job Scheduling**: Reinforcement learning can be used for efficient job scheduling in data centers. An innovative Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) deep reinforcement learning approach called A2cScheduler was proposed for job scheduling. It consists of two agents, the actor and the critic, which learn the scheduling policy and reduce the estimation error, respectively<sup>[5]</sup>.\n",

    "##### Adding memory to our application allows the user to have a conversation, however this feature is not something that comes with the LLM, but instead, memory is something that we must provide to the LLM in form of context of the question.\n",

    "We added persitent memory using CosmosDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also can notice that the current chain that we are using is smart, but not that much. Although we have given memory to it, it searches for similar docs everytime, regardless of the input and it struggles to respond to prompts like: Hello, Thank you, Bye, What's your name, What's the weather and any other task that is not search in the knowledge base.\n",

    "As we proceed, while all the code will remain compatible with GPT-3.5 models, we highly recommend transitioning to GPT-4. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-3.5-Turbo** can be likened to a 7-year-old child. You can provide it with concise instructions, but it frequently struggles to follow them accurately. Additionally, its limited memory can make sustained conversations challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k** resembles the same 7-year-old, but with an increased attention span for longer instructions. However, it still faces difficulties accurately executing them about half the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4** exhibits the capabilities of a 10-12-year-old child. It possesses enhanced reasoning skills and more consistently adheres to instructions. While its memory retention for instructions is moderate, it excels at following them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4-32k** is akin to the 10-12-year-old child with an extended memory. It comprehends lengthy sets of instructions and engages in meaningful conversations. Thanks to its robust memory, it offers detailed responses.\n",
